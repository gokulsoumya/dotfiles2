# Proprietary Media Support For Vivaldi

Start Vivaldi from the command line; installation instructions will be displayed if support file is not installed. Info from [here](https://help.vivaldi.com/article/html5-proprietary-media-on-linux/).

For chromium based browsers, install the `chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra` package (the installation instructions from Vivaldi does this automatically and extracts the necessary files).
